- _**Why did I decide to opensource orsted**_ ?

It is my way to leave a mark and humbly contribute back to the opensource community. The project is far from perfect but it may inspire others.

Plus I believe in a saying _"Only Noobs Gatekeep"_. 


- _**Will I maintain this project**_ ?

I plan to. However I cannot commit to anything given that it is a personal project I do on my free time.
